# Getting your copy working.
The files are all working except `8.0.1f` (incomplete server side), `5.6.1` and `8.0.0m`.

If you selected any of those versions when dont expect your copy to work fully.

here are some tips to get it working.

## 1. Running in studio.
Some versions (Namely `4.7.1k` and `8.0.1f`) are fully working without publishing to roblox, though some like the 3.0.5 version and 2016 version (and all of its child archive versions stored in it.) do NOT work without publishing to roblox.

## 2. Publishing to roblox.
This involves you publishing the place file to roblox, this is required in order to enable some permissions for the 2016 copy because it needs access to the database apis.

## 3. Trouble shooting yourself.
Im not a mastermind, so even if you contact me on discord and youve tried everything then dont expect much from my help, i have lots of experience modding 2016 pf, but not much else.


At last, dm `luajit` on discord if u have any questions.
